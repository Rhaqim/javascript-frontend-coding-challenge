# Solution Docs
Disclaimer, this is my first time doing frontend.

I created a new file titled Ivan.js where I wrote down code for the api call I learnt from someone. I then used the promise to convert it into a json file and then displayed the log.
I tried to import it into the index.js file and then follow the code to have it converted in html drop down menu.

I wish I had more time to learn about it bootstrap and more of js, limited time and knowledge about the sbject led to me not fully grapsing it.
